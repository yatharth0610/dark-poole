This is the webpage for the course CS340 that I did during Spring 2021. The course was taught by Prof. Raghunath Tewari.   

The course had 4 assignments, 2 quizzes and mid semester end semester exam. I am posting here the assignments and their solutions only, since the other exams were conducted on Hello IITK and I haven't actually transcribed the solutions for them.
