This is the webpage for the course CS203 that I did during Fall 2020. The course was taught by Prof. Nitin Saxena.   

The course had 3 assignments, 3 quizzes and an end semester exam. I am posting here the assignments and their solutions only, since the other exams were conducted on Hello IITK and I don't have the transcribed solutions for them available.
