This is the webpage for the course CS771 that I did during Spring 2021. The course was taught by Prof. Nisheeth Srivastava.   

In this course, we were taught the basic machine learning algorithms and were asked to implement some of them and see their work in action through dedicated assignments. All of the assignments asked us to code from the scratch. I have provided the link to my attempts below. 

The assignments solutions with comments and observations are present in the repository [here](https://github.com/yatharth0610/CS771-Assignments).

\
_Fun-Fact_: I obtained an unexpected A* in the course and more importantly stood 1 in a class of 204 students taking the course during my time. (_Afterall who is stopping me from posting this stuff on my own page xD._)

\
_Remark_ : Please keep in mind that I am purely posting these solutions out of interest and do not take any responsibility of the correctness of the solutions posted. Please feel free to reach out to me through [mail](ygoswami@iitk.ac.in) in case you find an error.
