This is the webpage for the course CS253 that I did during Fall 2020. The course was taught by Prof. Subhajit Roy.   

In this course, we were taught various tools and techniques which are frequently used in the world of Software Development. It also taught stuff which will be relevant and useful for future courses. It can be considered as the only course which will teach you basics of essential stuff like git, bash etc. which will be assumed to be known in the future course. 

The assignments, exams and their solutions with dedicated writeup are present in the repository [here](https://github.com/yatharth0610/CS253).
