This is the webpage for the course MTH511 that I did during Spring 2021. The course was taught by Prof. Dootika Vats.   

This course was taught in two phases. The first phase covered simulation techniques and taught us techniques that are used for sampling from a given distribution. We were also taught simulation techniques like Monte Carlo in this part. The next phase covered Data Analysis and we were taught various methods prevelant in the modern Statistics community for modelling of data. More details about the course can be found [here](https://dvats.github.io/teaching/MTH511.html).

The problem set and mini-project solutions can be found [here](https://dvats.github.io/teaching/MTH511.html).
