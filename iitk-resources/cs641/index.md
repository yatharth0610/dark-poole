This is the webpage for the course CS641 that I did during Fall 2020. The course was taught by Prof. Manindra Agarwal.   

This is certainly one of the most interesting courses offered by CSE, IITK. What can be more interesting than completing a game as part of your coursework? The assignments are offered as completing a certain level of game which requires you to put the crypto techniques you will learn alongside to use. 

The course was done in a group of 3 students. Assignments were a bit hectic since they required you to try different approaches and crack the cyptic codes. Midsem and Endsem were more on mathematical and reasoning side and so were somewhat tougher than the assignments.

# Assignments 

You can find all the assignments and our attempted solutions [here](https://github.com/yatharth0610/CS641). We have used different languages like C, C++, Python, Go, Sage and Bash to complete the assignments (to maybe showoff :P or hone our Programming Language knowledge xD).

_Fun-Fact_ : Ended up being amongst the top teams to secure an A* (for exceptional performance) in the course.
