This is the webpage for the course CS345 that I did during Spring 2021. The course was taught by Prof. Surender Baswana.   

The course had 3 assignments, 3 quizzes and mid semester end semester exam. I am posting here the assignments and their solutions only, since the other exams were conducted on Hello IITK and I haven't actually transcribed the solutions for them. 

All the assignments were done in a group of 2 people.
