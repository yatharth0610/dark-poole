This is the webpage for the course CS220 that I did during Fall 2020. The course was taught by Prof. Mainak Choudhuri.   

Being a systems enthusiast, this has to be certainly one of the most interesting course I found in the UG curriculum. I actually got to know the internals of how computer actually work and how beautifully the underlying mechanisms are designed. 

In this course, we were asked to form a team of 2 and code for tasks provided in the assignments. Most of the assignments required using verilog for hardware simulation, and the rest required to code in pure assembly. 

The assignments and their solutions are present in the dedicated repository [here](https://github.com/yatharth0610/CS220).
